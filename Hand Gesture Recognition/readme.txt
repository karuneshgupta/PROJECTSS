 primary objective is to develop a system that can accurately interpret hand movements and 
recognize the corresponding ASL gestures and English alphabet signs. By utilizing computer 
vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, we can analyze the positions and 
movements of the user's hand in real-time, extracting meaningful features that differentiate 
different gestures
